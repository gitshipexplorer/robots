  <h1>ROBOTS!</h1>
   <p>A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer—capable of carrying out a
     complex series of actions automatically.<br>A robot can be guided by an external control
     device, or the control may be embedded within.<br>Robots may be constructed to evoke
     human form, but most robots are task-performing machines, designed with an emphasis on
     stark functionality, rather than expressive aesthetics.</p>

     A robot is a programmable machine that can complete a task, while the term robotics describes
     the field of study focused on developing robots and automation.
     As technology progresses, so too does the scope of what is considered robotics. In 2005, 90 percent of
     all robots could be found assembling cars in automotive factories. These robots consist mainly of mechanical
     arms tasked with welding or screwing on certain parts of a car. </div>

     The word robot is derived from the Czech word robota, which means “forced labor.” The word first appeared
     in the 1920 play R.U.R., in reference to the play’s characters who were mass-produced workers incapable of
     creative thinking.</div>
